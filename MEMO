- the method for debugging: sh ./libtool --mode=execute gdb horus-file

- server-side timing measure is not necessary, I guess.
  we saturate the server by using multiple client.
  Each kds_client benchmarks the q/s for him.
  The number of clients are increased, like, 3,4,5,6..
  At some point the q/s will start to degrade.
  we can infer from them how much q/s the server has.

- you need to reset fd_set everytime before calling select().
  I think fcntl(O_NONBLOCK) does not have any meaning in networking.
  see select(2).

- it's better to think about semantis. if the semantically different,
  you'd better to use different "if ()" statement. e.g.:
      if (thread_count () < HORUS_THREAD_MAX && FD_ISSET (fd, &fds))

- I think you need to increment thread_count when you call
  pthread_create(). Otherwise, two threads may be located at the same
  index in the array.
