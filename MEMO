- the method for debugging: sh ./libtool --mode=execute gdb horus-file

- server-side timing measure is not necessary, I guess.
  we saturate the server by using multiple client.
  Each kds_client benchmarks the q/s for him.
  The number of clients are increased, like, 3,4,5,6..
  At some point the q/s will start to degrade.
  we can infer from them how much q/s the server has.
