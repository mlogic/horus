- the method for debugging: sh ./libtool --mode=execute gdb horus-file

- struct key_request still includes pointers. Is it not used anymore ?
  In order to read/write a struct to the network, we need to eliminate
  pointers.
- Indicating the IP address as "IP" is wrong. e.g.: kds_ip -> kds_ip_addr.
  if in usage message, A.B.C.D will be better.
- src/kds.c is gone ? put it back.
- again, kr2str() is not necessary. we don't want ascii string to go to
  network. just sending integers with network byteorder (in the struct)
  will be okay. The current method of: 1) setting struct, 2) converting to
  string/ascii, and 3) sendto() is redundant.
  Make it like 1) fill the struct, and 2) sendto().
- use getopt argument handling like src/horus_file.c and src/horus_key.c

- We need to produce a code such that we can benchmark the query/sec of
  the server as soon as possible, at least until the weekend.
